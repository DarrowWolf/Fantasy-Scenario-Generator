# Fantasy-Scenario-Generator
A Python script that generates random sentences combining a species and a scenario.
The species are selected from a list of species and the scenario is selected from a list of scenarios.
The generated sentences are saved to a text file.


This was made cause I was too lazy to type out each spceies and scenario.. so why not use Python to do it for me!
